## Panther-Speed

UPE Sparkdev aims to generate student engagement and enthusiasm to technology in our community. This IT project, Panther Speed, focused on developing a website that tests the different internet speeds throughout FIU's campus by implementing a raspberry pi device in each campus building, which performs a stress test that generates the upload and download speed, with an exposed API. The website would be updated every 3 minutes to showcase the different  internet connectivity speeds with an organized chart graph, allowing students to determine which building to study in if Internet speed is a priority for them. Panther Speed achieves a simplistic and convenient tool for students on campus.      
## Technologies Used: Raspberry Pi Device, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Speedtest CLI, CentOS 7, Python and Pymongo package, MongoDB, BASH Script, Wondershaper
